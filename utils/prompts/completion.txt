my server is failing to install Node.JS, go to the eggactyl_config.yml file in your container and insert the following code: version: 2 lang: en software: type: discord_node node_version: "16" package_manager: npm bot: start_file: index.js
I am receiving an error that says my Node_Modules version doesn't match - send a code block with `Solution: Delete your Node_Modules folder and restart your server.`
My tar.gz file isn't uploading - send a code block `solution: Convert it into a .zip file, to do so, right click the tar.gz file on your computer and click "compress to zip" and then upload the ZIP`
what are the server options for on checkout? - When it comes to the server options, only change it if you know what you are doing, those are your startup options and are available anytime so for now click checkout!
